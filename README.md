# Topic 5: Capstone - Journal API

Welcome to your Python capstone project! You'll be working with a **FastAPI + PostgreSQL** application that helps people track their daily learning journey. This will prepare you for deploying to the cloud in the next phase.

By the end of this capstone, your API should be working locally and ready for cloud deployment.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git installed on your machine
- Docker Desktop installed and running
- VS Code with the Dev Containers extension

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account by clicking the "Fork" button
2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/journal-starter.git
   cd journal-starter
   ```

3. **Open in VS Code**:

   ```bash
   code .
   ```

### 2. Configure Your Environment (.env)

Environment variables live in a `.env` file (which is **git-ignored** so you don't accidentally commit secrets). This repo ships with a template named `.env-sample`.

1. Copy the sample file to create your real `.env`:

   ```bash
   cp .env-sample .env
   ```

2. Open `.env` and review the contents. It should look like this:

   ```env
   POSTGRES_USER=postgres
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
   POSTGRES_DB=career_journal
   
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/career_journal
   ```

3. The DATABASE_URL value points to the PostgreSQL container you started in the previous step. Your database credentials are also stored via environment variables.

Why a sample file? 
- Keeps secrets out of Git history
- Lets teammates (or future you) know which variables are required
- Makes onboarding predictable

If you break the file, you can always re-copy from `.env-sample`.

### 3. Set Up Your Development Environment

1. **Install the Dev Containers extension** in VS Code (if not already installed)
2. **Reopen in container**: When VS Code detects the `.devcontainer` folder, click "Reopen in Container"
   - Or use Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`): `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`
3. **Wait for setup**: The API container will automatically install Python, dependencies, and configure your environment.
   The PostgreSQL Database container will also automatically be created.

### 4. Verify the PostgreSQL Database Is Running

   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```

   You should see the postgres service running.

### 5. Run the API

```bash
# From the project root (should already be your current directory)
./start.sh
```

### 6. Test Everything Works! üéâ

1. **Visit the API docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs
2. **Try the working endpoints**:
   - POST `/entries` - Create a new journal entry
   - GET `/entries` - View all your journal entries
   - PATCH `/entries/{id}` - Update an entry
   - DELETE `/entries` - Delete all entries

3. **Create your first entry** using the docs interface to make sure everything is connected!
4. **View your entries** using the GET `/entries` endpoint to see what you've created!

**üéØ Once you can create and see entries, you're ready to start implementing the missing endpoints!**

## üîß Troubleshooting

**If the API won't start:**
- Make sure the PostgreSQL container is running: `docker-compose ps`
- Check the container logs: `docker-compose logs postgres`
- Restart the database: `docker-compose restart postgres`

**If you can't connect to the database:**
- Verify the `.env` file exists and has the correct DATABASE_URL
- Make sure Docker Desktop is running
- Try restarting the dev container: `Dev Containers: Rebuild Container`

**If the dev container won't open:**
- Ensure Docker Desktop is running
- Install the "Dev Containers" extension in VS Code
- Try: `Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container`

## üóÑÔ∏è Explore Your Database (Optional)

Want to see your data directly in the database? You can connect to PostgreSQL using VS Code's PostgreSQL extension:

### 1. Install PostgreSQL Extension

1. **Install the PostgreSQL extension** in VS Code (search for "PostgreSQL" by Chris Kolkman)
2. **Restart VS Code** after installation

### 2. Connect to Your Database
1. **Open the PostgreSQL extension** (click the PostgreSQL icon in the sidebar)
2. **Click "Add Connection"** or the "+" button
3. **Enter these connection details**:
   - **Host name**: `postgres`
   - **User name**: `postgres`
   - **Password**: `postgres`
   - **Port**: `5432`
   - **Conection Type**: `Standard/No SSL`
   - **Database**: `career_journal`
   - **Display name**: `Journal Starter DB` (or any name you prefer)

### 3. Explore Your Data
1. **Expand your connection** in the PostgreSQL panel
2. **Left-click on "Journal Starter DB" to expand**
3. **Right-click on "career_journal"**
4. **Select "New Query"**
5. **Type this query** to see all your entries:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM entries;
   ```
6. **Run the query** to see all your journal data! (Ctrl/Cmd + Enter OR use the PostgreSQL command pallete: Run Query)

You can now explore the database structure, see exactly how your data is stored, and run custom queries to understand PostgreSQL better.

## Project Structure

This project uses a clean FastAPI architecture with PostgreSQL:

```
api/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py                    # FastAPI app entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt           # Python dependencies  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ entry.py              # Pydantic data models
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ repositories/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ interface_repository.py    # Database interface
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ postgres_repository.py     # PostgreSQL implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ routers/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ journal_router.py     # API endpoints (YOUR MAIN WORK HERE)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ services/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ entry_service.py      # Business logic layer
```

## Your Learning Goals

Complete a Journal API that allows users to:
- ‚úÖ **Store journal entries** (already implemented)
- ‚úÖ **Retrieve all journal entries** (already implemented) 
- ‚ùå **Retrieve single journal entry** (you need to implement)  
- ‚ùå **Delete specific journal entries** (you need to implement)
- ‚úÖ **Update journal entries** (already implemented)
- ‚úÖ **Delete all entries** (already implemented)
- ‚ùå **Setup logging** (you need to implement)

## üéØ Development Tasks (Your Work!)

### 1. API Implementation (Required)
**File: `api/routers/journal_router.py`**

Implement these missing endpoints:
- [ ] **GET /entries/{entry_id}** - Get single entry by ID  
- [ ] **DELETE /entries/{entry_id}** - Delete specific entry

Each endpoint has detailed TODO comments with step-by-step guidance!

### 2. Logging Setup (Required)
**File: `api/main.py`**

- [ ] Configure basic logging using `logging.basicConfig()`
- [ ] Set logging level to INFO
- [ ] Add console handler
- [ ] Test with a startup log message

### 3. Data Model Improvements (Optional)
**File: `api/models/entry.py`**

- [ ] Add custom field validators (e.g., minimum length)
- [ ] Add data sanitization methods
- [ ] Add schema version tracking

### 4. Cloud CLI Setup (Required for Deployment)
**File: `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`**

- [ ] Choose and uncomment ONE cloud CLI tool:
  - Azure CLI: `"ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/azure-cli:1": {}`
  - AWS CLI: `"ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/aws-cli:1": {}`  
  - Google Cloud CLI: `"ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/gcloud:1": {}`

## üìä Data Schema

Each journal entry follows this structure:

| Field       | Type      | Description                                | Validation                   |
|-------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| id          | string    | Unique identifier (UUID)                   | Auto-generated               |
| work        | string    | What did you work on today?                | Required, max 256 characters |
| struggle    | string    | What's one thing you struggled with today? | Required, max 256 characters |
| intention   | string    | What will you study/work on tomorrow?      | Required, max 256 characters |
| created_at  | datetime  | When entry was created                     | Auto-generated UTC           |
| updated_at  | datetime  | When entry was last updated                | Auto-updated UTC             |

## üîå API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint           | Status | Description                    |
|--------|--------------------|--------|--------------------------------|
| POST   | /entries           | ‚úÖ Done | Create new journal entry       |
| GET    | /entries           | ‚úÖ Done | List all journal entries       |
| GET    | /entries/{id}      | ‚ùå TODO | Get single entry by ID         |
| PATCH  | /entries/{id}      | ‚úÖ Done | Update existing entry          |
| DELETE | /entries/{id}      | ‚ùå TODO | Delete specific entry          |
| DELETE | /entries           | ‚úÖ Done | Delete all entries             |

## ‚úÖ How to Complete This Project
